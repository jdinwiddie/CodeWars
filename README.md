# Daily Javascript Codewars Exercises

This project is a personal project to keep me improving my programming skills.
CodeWars is a website that has programmers post challenges.  You can complete as many
as you like, but my goal is to complete at least one every day.  I used Python/Flask
as the background originally in hopes to throw in some SQL exercises as well, but
I might not end up doing that.  I'm just keeping all my doors open right now.

This is used for personal growth; however, you are welcome to check out my code.  I publish each exercise in the [Exercises](#exercises) section.
